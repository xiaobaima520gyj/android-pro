	<string name="home_text">Its the women dancing,Sir John.The boy went
		on his way and Durbeyfield lay waiting in the evening sun.Nobody
		passed by for a long time,and he could just hear the faint music
		in the distance. The village of Marlott lies in the beautiful
		Vale of Blackmoor.Although this valley is only four hours
		away from London,it has not yet been discovered by tourists
		and artists.The best view of the vale is from the hills surrounding
		it;it looks like a map spread out.It is a quiet,sheltered
		part of the countryside,where the fields are always green
		and the rivers never dry up.To the south lies the great dividing line
		of hills.From here to the coast the hills are open,the sun pours down
		on the huge dry fields,the atmosphere is colourless.But here in the valley
		lies a completely different countryside,smaller and more delicate.The fields
		are tiny,the air makes you sleepy,the sky is of the deepest blue.Everywhere
		you can see a rich greenery of grass and trees,covering smaller hills and
		valleys.This is the Vale of Blackmoor. And in the village of Marlott,following
		ancient custom,the young women gathered to dance every holiday. For this May- Day
		dance,all wore white dresses.There was a fine,handsome girl among them,with a red
		ribbon in her hair.As they danced,they noticed a carriage go by. Durbeyfield lay back
		in it,singing,The girl with the ribbon,who was called Tess,turned red and said quickly
		to her friends,Fathers tired,thats all.The other girls just laughed but stopped when
		Tess looked unhappy.The dancing went on. In the evening the men of the village came to
		watch and later to join the dancers.Three young strangers,who were passing by,also stopped
		to look.They explained they were brothers on a walking tour.The older two continued their
		walk,but the youngest seemed more interested in the girls than his brothers were,and
		stayed to dance with several of them. As he left the dance, he noticed Tess, who seemed
		a little sad that he had not chosen her. He looked back from the road, and could still
		see her in her white dress, standing modestly apart from the dancers. He wished he had
		danced with her. He wished he had asked her name. But it was too late.He hurried on to
		join his brothers. The young stranger had made an impression on Tess. But soon, worried
		by her fathers strange appearance that afternoon,she decided to walk home. After the
		excitement of the dance, her parentssmall cottage was a depressing sight.It was dark
		inside, as they had only one candle.The furniture was old and worn. There were six children
		crowded into the tiny space.Their mother was doing the washing at the same time as putting
		the baby to sleep.</string>
